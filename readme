# LogChain – Tamper-Proof Server Logs on Solana

## Problem
Server logs are the #1 forensic evidence in breaches — but they're mutable. Attackers erase tracks. Auditors can't trust logs. No system proves integrity post-incident.

## Solution
LogChain hashes every log line, builds a Merkle tree, and anchors the root to Solana every 100 entries. Tampering breaks the chain — instantly detectable and provable.

## Tech Stack
- Off-chain: Node.js + merkletreejs
- On-chain: Anchor (Rust) + Solana
- Frontend: React + Solana Wallet Adapter
